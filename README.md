# Hi, I’m Shikha 👋  

_AI Project & Delivery Manager | Technical Program Manager (AI/ML)_

I help teams turn **AI ideas into production-ready products**. My work sits at the intersection of:

- AI & data (LLMs, classical ML, automation)
- Software delivery (roadmaps, releases, risk management)
- Stakeholders (engineering, product, business)

I enjoy taking ambiguous problem statements, structuring them into clear plans, and guiding cross‑functional teams from proof‑of‑concept to reliable, monitored deployments.

## 🔧 Focus Areas

- **AI Project Management**
  - End‑to‑end delivery of AI/ML and automation projects
  - Scoping, roadmapping, and defining success metrics
  - Running discovery, PoC, MVP, and rollout phases

- **Technical Delivery**
  - Working with Python‑based stacks, APIs, and basic data pipelines
  - Understanding of MLOps concepts: data, experiments, deployment, monitoring
  - Partnering with engineers and data scientists to ship features, not just prototypes

- **Stakeholder & Change Management**
  - Translating between business and technical teams
  - Clear written and verbal communication, demos, and status updates
  - Driving adoption, feedback loops, and continuous improvement

## 📈 How I Work

- **Outcome‑driven:** I anchor AI work on clear business value (time saved, quality improved, revenue impact).  
- **Technical‑aware:** I’m not a full‑time engineer, but I can read code, understand architecture diagrams, and ask the right questions to unblock teams.  
- **Calm & structured:** I try to create predictable environments—clear priorities, known risks, and transparent communication.  
- **Collaborative:** I enjoy pairing with engineers, designers, and product managers to find pragmatic solutions.
